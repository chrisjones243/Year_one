    "# Part 1 (compulsory, worth 70% of the mark for this assignment) - Spam filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Spam refers to unwanted email, often in the form of advertisements. In the literature, an email that is **not** spam is called *ham*. Most email providers offer automatic spam filtering, where spam emails will be moved to a separate inbox based on their contents. Of course this requires being able to scan an email and determine whether it is spam or ham, a classification problem. This is the subject of this part of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to write a supervised learning based classifier to determine whether a given email is spam or ham. You must write and submit the code in this notebook. The training data is provided for you. You may use any classification method. Marks will be awarded primarily based on the accuracy of your classifier on unseen test data, but there are also marks for estimating how accurate you think your classifier will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choice of Algorithm\n",
    "While the classification method is a completely free choice, the assignment folder includes [a separate notebook file](data/naivebayes.ipynb) which can help you implement a Naïve Bayes solution. If you do use this notebook, you are still responsible for porting your code into *this* notebook for submission. A good implementation should give a high  enough accuracy to get a good grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also consider a k-nearest neighbour algorithm, but this may be less accurate. Logistic regression is another option that you may wish to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking to go beyond the scope of the unit, you might be interested in building something more advanced, like an artificial neural network. This is possible just using `numpy`, but will require significant self-directed learning. *Extensions like this are left unguided and are not factored into the unit workload estimates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** you may use helper functions in libraries like `numpy` or `scipy`, but you **must not** import code which builds entire models for you. This includes but is not limited to use of libraries like `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, or `pytorch` – there will be plenty of opportunities for these libraries in later units. The point of this assignment is to understand code of the actual algorithm yourself. ***If you are in any doubt about any particular library or function please ask the teaching team.*** Submissions which ignore this will receive penalties or even zero marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to implement more than one algorithm, please feel free to include your code in a separate file and talk about it the readme file, but only the code in this notebook will be used in the automated testing and it will form your mark. You may get extra points for the additional algorithm, but it is not guaranteed. Therefore, if of any doubt, it is better to spend your time focusing on making one algorithm working to its best performance rather than to implement an additional algorithm.\n",

You will be assessed on the additional hidden test data. You should consider how to best make use of all available data without overfitting, and to help produce an unbiased estimate for your classifier's accuracy.\n",

    "# Part 2 (optional, to get more than 70% of the mark for this assignment) - Feature engineering for digit classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical character recognition ([OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) is the task of extracting text from image sources. The dataset on which you will run your classifier is a collection of handwritten numerical digits (0-9). This is a subsample of the famous [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, which serves as a popular playground in machine learning research. OCR is a very commercially useful technology, and some existing systems can achieve over 99% classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to train a classifier to recognise a given image of a handwritten digit as one of 10 classes $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 9\\}$ that corresponds to the written digit. You may use any classification method including the same classification method you use for part 1 for spam filtering. If your `MyClassifier` class can generalise to an arbitrary number of input features and artibtary number of class labels, you may use the same `MyClassifier` for both parts. You will need to have **two different instances** (`spam_classifier = MyClassifier()` and `digit_classifier = MyClassifier()`) for part 1 and part 2 of the assignment. The main task of part 2 is to improve the classification accuracy via feature engineering (see below). You mark will not directly depend on your choice of classification method and its initial accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building classifiers is only a small part of getting a good system working for a task. Indeed, the main difference between a good classification system and a bad one is usually not the classifier itself (e.g., perceptron vs. naïve Bayes), but rather the quality of the features used. \n",
    "\n",
    "For digit classification we start with the simplest possible features: for each pixel we use a binary variable, which is set to 1 if a pixel is on (its' colour is not black), or it is set to 0 if a pixel is off (its' colour is black). These are the basic features with which you will need to compare. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the accuracy of your classifier, you will need to extract more useful features from the data by completing the `BetterFeatureExtractor` function below. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: You are free to choose how to approach this task. This is just a possible suggestion. When analyzing your classifiers' results on the base features, you should look at some of your errors and look for characteristics of the input that would give the classifier useful information about the label. For instance in the digit data, consider the number of separate, connected regions of white pixels, which varies by digit type. Digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 tend to have one contiguous region of white space while the loops in digits 6, 8, 9 create more. The number of white regions in digit 4 depends on the writer. This is an example of a feature that is not directly available to the classifier from the per-pixel information. If your feature extractor adds new features that encode these properties, the classifier will be able to exploit them. Note that some features may require non-trivial computation to extract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add new **binary** features for the digit dataset in the `BetterFeatureExtractor` function below. Note that you can encode a categorical feature which takes N values [1,2,...,N] by using N binary features, of which only one is on at the time, to indicate which of the N possibilities you have. In theory, features aren't conditionally independent as naïve Bayes requires, but it can still work well in practice. Note that you may add new feature(s) to the set of basic features, or use only new feature(s) instead of the basic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marks for this part of the assignment are given based on the improvement you achieve by using new feature(s) in comparison to the base features on additional hidden data. You will get some marks for implementing new feature(s) which yield any improvement at all. Further marks are given based on how large is the gain in accuracy you achieve. Note that the marks don't depend on the initial accuracy achieved based on the basic features (as long as it is higher than 10% (random guess for a 10-class classification problem)). \n",
