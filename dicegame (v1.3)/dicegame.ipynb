    "Please ensure you carefully read all of the details and instructions on the assignment page, this section, and the rest of the notebook. If anything is unclear at any time please post on the forum or ask a tutor well in advance of the assignment deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to all of the instructions in the body of the assignment below, you must also follow the following technical instructions for all assignments in this unit. *Failure to do so may result in a grade of zero.*\n",
    "* [At the bottom of the page](#Submission-Test) is some code which checks you meet the submission requirements. You **must** ensure that this runs correctly before submission.\n",
    "* Do not modify or delete any of the cells that are marked as test cells, even if they appear to be empty.\n",
    "* Do not duplicate any cells in the notebook – this can break the marking script. Instead, insert a new cell (e.g. from the menu) and copy across any contents as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to save and backup your work regularly, and double-check you are submitting the correct version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is the primary reference for your submission. You may write code in separate `.py` files but it must be clearly imported into the notebook so that it runs without needing to reference those files, and you must explain clearly what functionality is contained in those files (through comments, markdown cells, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, **the work you submit for this assignment must be entirely your own.** Do not copy or work with other students. Do not copy answers that you find online. These assignments are designed to help improve your understanding first and foremost – the process of doing the assignment is part of *learning*. They are also used to assess your ability, and so you must uphold academic integrity. Submitting plagiarised work risks your entire place on your degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The pass mark for this assignment is 40%.** We expect that students, on average, will be able to produce a submission which gets a mark between 50-70%, but this will vary depending on individual backgrounds. Please ask for help if you are struggling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be writing an agent that can play a simple dice game. Here are the basic rules:\n",
    "* You start with 0 points\n",
    "* Roll three fair six-sided dice\n",
    "* Now choose one of the following:\n",
    " * Stick, accept the values shown. If two or more dice show the same values, then those dice are flipped upside down: 1 becomes 6, 2 becomes 5, 3 becomes 4, and vice versa. The total is then added to your points and this is your final score.\n",
    " * OR reroll the dice. You may choose to hold any combination of the dice on the current value shown. Rerolling costs you 1 point – so during the game and perhaps even at the end your score may be negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best possible score for this game is 18, and is achieved by rolling either three 1s, or two 1s and one 6, on the first roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reroll penalty prevents you from rolling forever to get this score. If the value of the current dice is greater than the expected value of rerolling them (accounting for the penalty), then you should stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal decision is independent of your current score. It does not matter whether it is your first roll with a current score of 0, or your twentieth roll with a current score of -19 (in which case a positive end score is impossible), in either of these cases if you roll three 6s (which, if you stick, will only add 3 points) then you still expect to get a *better* end score by rerolling and taking the penalty. Almost any other roll will beat it, so it's still the right choice to maximise your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is pretty obvious that you should stick on three 1s, and reroll on three 6s. Should you hold any of the 6s when you reroll? What about other values? What should you do if the dice come up 3, 4, 5?\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know what numbers will come up when we roll, but we do know exactly what the probability of any given roll is. This is the point of the probabilistic reasoning section of the unit; if we can model the true probabilities then we can mathematically calculate the optimal policy. Not all real world situations use dice, but these techniques work well even if we can only estimate the true probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Play The Game\n",
    "You can play the game in the following cell. Change the `SKIP_GAME` constant to `False` to enable this cell. \n",
    "<br> *Make sure to change it back to `True` before submitting.*"

    "### Submission Requirements\n",
    "The code supports playing this game with many possible modifications – you can change the number of dice, the values on the dice, or even make biased (weighted) dice that are more likely to roll certain values. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will need to submit:\n",
    "1. The agent implementations which answer the **4 assignments** – this notebook\n",
    " * Your code will be subject to automated testing, from which grades will be assigned depending on how well your agent plays the game (potentially with modifications)\n",
    " * To get a high grade on this assignment, the speed of your code will also be a factor – the quicker the better\n",
    " * There are some sample tests and skeleton code included below, make sure your code is compatible with the format of these tests\n",
    "2. A text file that explains your approach and the decisions you made in your own words – a readme file\n",
    " * Submissions that do not include the written section will receive zero marks – **this part is mandatory**\n",
    " * You may write your file in plain text (.txt) or [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) (.md)\n",
    " * To get top marks on this assignment, as well as getting a high grade from your implementation, you must also demonstrate excellent academic presentation in your written section\n",
    " \n",
    "### Choice of Algorithm\n",
    "You can take any approach you like to write your agent. We have provided two examples for you, though these agents do not perform very well, and would not pass the assignment, they should help you structure your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered *value iteration* in the unit, and this technique will work well here to produce a strategy for the game, which your agent can then follow. It is up to you to work out the parameters that will be suit the value iteration algorithm to maximise your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many other possible options. Simply calculating the expected value of a single roll will produce a much stronger strategy than playing randomly. You could also look up various other approaches that can be applied to Markov decision processes, such as policy iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a high grade on this assignment will require a particularly efficient implementation value iteration with intelligent choice of parameters, or something which goes beyond the material we have presented. *This is left unguided and is not factored into the unit workload estimates.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can write your agent to support modified versions of the game, which is also demonstrated below. For submissions that support this, the tests will include modified versions of the game, some where the game is *more obvious*, and some where it is *less obvious* than the default rules. Getting high marks requires supporting this feature. For those who are struggling to write a good agent, supporting this feature will result in additional tests which are more forgiving, so this might be an attractive option.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to implement more than one algorithm, please feel free to include your code and write about it in part two (readme file), but only the code in this notebook will be used in the automated testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dice Game Class\n",
    "A class called `DiceGame` is provided within `dice_game.py` for you to use in your solution. Here is a demonstration of its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a DiceGame object, by default you will get the rules as stated above. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "game = DiceGame()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Creates a game with 3 normal 6-sided dice. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may wish to modify the game mechanics, and you can do this using the other constructor arguments, for example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "game = DiceGame(dice=4, sides=3, values=[1, 2, 6], bias=[0.1, 0.1, 0.8], penalty=2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will create a game where you roll 4 dice, each with 3 sides, labelled 1, 2, and 6, where each die is far more likely to roll a 6 than they are to roll a 1 or a 2, and furthermore the penalty for rerolling is now 2 points instead of 1. *Note: this does not necessarily result in an interesting game.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In games with unusual values or sides (3-sided dice are unusual without trying to turn them upside down), when there are duplicates, `value[i]` becomes `value[-i]`. With odd-sided dice, the middle value will flip onto itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created, the `DiceGame` object can be run in two different modes, *simulation* and *analysis*. It is likely that you will mostly use [*analysis* mode](#Analysis-Mode) to derive your agent's behaviour, but either way some understanding of simulation mode might be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Mode\n",
    "The object provides the methods required to simulate playing the game. This might be useful if you want to test your agent, or you just want to try playing the game yourself, as we did in the cell earlier. The current dice values are found by calling `get_dice_state()`, they will always be listed in ascending order. "

    "Up to this point, we have covered how the dice game works and provided some examples of simple agents that can play the game - specifically an agent that always holds regardless of the value on the dice, the `AlwaysHoldAgent`, and an agent that will continue to re-roll the dice until they get the perfect score, called the `PerfectionistAgent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, as the game progresses the reward available reduces as taking more re-rolls will eventually result in so many penalties that they will always outweigh any positive score obtained. So although the perfectionist may get lucky and get a high score early in the game if the agent takes too many goes then its score will be worse than had it just held onto what it already had. As such a hybrid strategy of the `AlwaysHoldAgent` and the `PerfectionistAgent` should on average outperform them individually given enough games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore your first task will be to create a hybrid agent of the `AlwaysHold` and `Perfectionist` agents. One thing you will need to investigate is when it is optimal to switch between the two strategies. When is better to chase perfection, and when is it best to just cut your losses and hold what you have?\n",

    "We have written a function in the dice_game.py file to help you do this: get_dice_score(), which can be used to calculate the current score on the dice, not including any penalties for rerolling.\n",
